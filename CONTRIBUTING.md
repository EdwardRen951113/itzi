# Contributing to Itzï

First of all, thanks to take time to contribute to Itzï.
This is much appreciated.
This file is a work in progress.
It will be updated as time goes.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Itzï Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
Please report unacceptable behaviour to [contact@itzi.org](mailto:contact@itzi.org).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
If a developer don't know about a bug, he/she cannot fix it!
Therefore, it is very valuable to thoroughly describe the problem you encounter on the bug-tracker.

### Write documentation

Documentation is critical for all users, especially new ones.
But writing good documentation is time consuming.

The documentation of Itzï is hosted on [Readthedocs](https://itzi.readthedocs.io).
It is written in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html)
and generated with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/).
The source code of the documentation lies on its own git [repository](https://bitbucket.org/itzi-model/itzi_docs).

Please use one sentence per line and try to keep line length under 90 characters.
If above that threshold, break the line.


### Code

Itzï is written in Python and [Cython](http://cython.org/).
We do our best to keep Itzï [PEP8-compliant](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
Please use the [pycodestyle](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycodestyle/) utility to check your code for compliance.
Sometimes it is difficult to keep the line length under 72 characters.
The line length could be extended to 90 characters in those cases.
